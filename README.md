# A-simulation-of-Simple-Harmonic-Motion-using-VPython.
Like the name says, this is a simulation of Simple Harmonic Motion using VPython. This was one of my projects I completed while studying Physics at university. 
This program can only be ran using VPython. 
To install VPython, use Python's package manager (pip) to install the VPython with:
pip install vpython
Or, you can paste the code into https://www.glowscript.org/
